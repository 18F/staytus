# Staytus Change Log

This file outlines the key changes between different revisions. The `stable`
branch will always contain the latest released version. Each version will
be tagged as appropriate.

Any version number which is suffixed by `-dev` means that it is currently
being developed and is not yet released. It is most likely you'll only ever
see this in a master branch.

## v1.0.0

* Initial Release
